#Statement
Given the year number. You need to check if this year is a leap year. If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.

The rules in Gregorian calendar are as follows:

a year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 and is not exactly divisible by 100
a year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400

Warning. The words LEAP and COMMON should be printed all caps.

Example input
2012

Example output
LEAP

# Read an integer:
year= int(input())
if(year%4==0):
  if(year%100==0):
    if(year%400==0):
      print("LEAP")
    else:
      print("COMMON")
  else:
    print("LEAP")
else:
  print("COMMON")
  
  
# Print a value:
# print(a)
